# EST or EDT? 🕰️

Welcome to the "EST or EDT?" website! This minimal project helps you quickly check whether it's currently Eastern Standard Time (EST) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).

## What does it do? 🤔

It's simple:

1. You visit the website
2. It tells you if it's EST or EDT
3. That's it! ✨

## Why? 🌟

Do you ever find yourself trying to schedule a meeting across timezones in the United States and you're unsure if it is EST or EDT? Now you can just check [est-or-edt.dev](https://est-or-edt.dev)!

## How it works 🛠️

This website is built with Svelte and automatically updates in real-time. So you'll always have the correct information, even if you leave the tab open during a time change.

## Enjoy! 😊

We hope this tiny tool makes your day just a little bit easier. If you like it, feel free to star the repo or share it with your friends!

Made with ❤️ and a bit of confusion about timezones.
